But the digital experience of public services has languished, a clunky relic of bureaucracy, to the point that it's diminishing overall civilian engagement. Kaizen Labs sets out to change that. They're bringing easy-to-use interfaces to government services for both the public and administrators, with a mission to revolutionize civic engagement and restore the public's trust in government services.

He was scared, he told us on our latest episode of Spotlight On. He didn’t want to just tack on AI features, and didn’t know exactly how a workflow tool would fit in or add value to this new world. He felt that if the company were going to survive AI, they'd need to fundamentally reimagine n8n in he process. Fast-forward three years, and n8n is not only a breakout name in AI, but increasingly proving itself as an essential component to AI architecture and orchestration.

""Expanding to the U.S."" almost always meant ""expanding to New York"" in practice. 2. The lists of names search firm returned that met all the criteria these founders had for B2B tech executives in New York were short – worryingly short. Those observations fueled this research with True Search, which examines what's happening in New York's tech scene, how it's shaping the talent pool there, and how founders can successfully navigate it. San Francisco's resurgence this past year has been well-documented and rightly celebrated. But the data and conversations we had with founders revealed that, quietly in the background, New York's emerged as another true B2B tech capital. And it's one, as Squarespace's Anthony Casalena put it, with an identity all its own.

My recent conversation with Vishal Sikka was exactly that. From leading SAP's HANA revolution and driving Infosys' transformation to now reimagining enterprise AI at Vianai Systems, Inc., Vishal has lived at the intersection of technology, philosophy and leadership. We spoke about what ""enterprise-grade AI"" really means in a world obsessed with speed over reliability, why enterprises are more like mangrove forests than machines (intricate, resilient & capable of withstanding shocks) and how India can shape the future of AI through its unique blend of scale, talent and systems thinking. Besides, if there's anyone who can weave an analogy between mangrove forests and enterprises and make it click, it's Vishal! These are insights that could only come from someone who has built, led and now re-imagines what the enterprise of the future looks like.

From day one, the team has been clear in their goal: to enable small & mid-sized businesses in Tier 2-4 cities to access formal credit. Their tech-led NBFC platform combines all the right ingredients, blending speed, data-driven underwriting and disciplined risk management. With ~₹315 crore in AUM and on track to cross ₹400 crore by FY26, Techfino's journey is a testament to the scale of MSME credit demand in India, which is estimated at ₹2 lakh crore+ every quarter.

Global software spending has surged to nearly $900 billion. Software companies have high upfront investment and strong gross margins. In contrast, services businesses require less capital to start and scale linearly with leaner gross margins.Over the past decade, software businesses have dominated the spotlight due to their repeatable revenue streams, fast cash collection, and attractive margins. With the right PMF and a scalable GTM strategy, they can grow rapidly, which explains why SaaS companies command high valuations despite their linear sales processes.Services, on the other hand, often lack differentiation and predictability. Operating under a âweâll do whatever you needâ blanket, they struggle to achieve clear product-market fit till they reach a certain scale. For these businesses, their ability to grow rely on factors like sales capabilities, delivery scalability, cost management, and securing long-term contracts. As these companies mature, they often attract growth-stage or private equity investors. The emergence of large language models (LLM) has dramatically altered the frontier of what is possible for machines to do, particularly for tasks that are sequential and involve both unstructured and structured data. As a result of this, there are two key trends weâre seeing:AI agents are taking over many tasks that are either being done in-house by companies or by services companies, cutting down on the need for human effort.As software becomes more AI native, its inherent inaccuracies will make a human-in-the-loop layer essential to keep everything running smoothly.While #1 is widely understood today, we believe that there is a lack of appreciation for #2. AI software are fundamentally probabilistic, and are prone to hallucinations. Even 90% accuracy is considered high. Some of this may be acceptable for low criticality applications e.g. prediction of next movie a user may want to see, or autocomplete in a text box. However, for most business works, this is not acceptable. Take, for instance, a real estate software startup we recently spoke with. Theyâre focused on automating the closing process for residential real estate transactions in the US. This process involves multiple steps, including exchanging emails and scanned documents, extracting key information, performing actions based on that data, navigating and inputting information into packaged software, and handling payment transactions. In total, there are around 20-50 such micro-steps. Even if each individual step has an accuracy rate of over 95%, the likelihood of completing all 20 steps without any errors drops to just 35%. This highlights the complexity and potential for errors in automating such intricate workflows. For 50 steps, the probability drops to just 7.5%. You canât afford to manage a $1M+ transaction with a 90% chance of error!Today, most software companies offer AI solutions but place the responsibility for outcomes on the buyer. However, we believe that over the next decade, a growing number of companies will emerge that provide both software and services. These services wonât be limited to one-time implementation; they will also include ongoing, human-led support to manage edge cases and ensure oversight, guaranteeing the accuracy and reliability of AI-driven outputs.The emergence of âPlatform BPOâ companiesThe nature of these emerging companies is neither purely software nor services, but a true hybrid of both. Traditional services companies typically offer a wide range of services, operating on a simple principle: once inside an account, expand as much as possible. The lines between âwhat we doâ and âwhat we donâtâ are often blurred, leading to continuous service expansion. As contracts grow larger and longer, sales costs as a percentage of revenue decrease, while resource utilisation â an essential driver of profitability â increases, thanks to more predictable, long-term engagements. For Indian services firms, an additional profit driver is the ability to offshore a significant portion of their workforce. This strategy has helped create global giants like TCS and Infosys, built on this very model.Itâs important to remember that even software companies often need services â sometimes seen as a necessary evil. When working with large enterprises, consulting, implementation, and ongoing support are crucial. While these services typically carry lower margins than software itself, they are essential for ensuring value realization and reducing churn, making them indispensable. Software companies also require significant upfront investment and continuous R&D to stay competitive. As a result, most remain highly focused on their core offerings. Itâs usually only when they reach $100M+ in ARR that they start e...",,allinvestorinvestorsThank you! Your submission has been received!Oops!

**Re:** Building India's Automation Infrastructure

## THE CORE INSIGHT

India's economic trajectory depends on solving a fundamental equation: **10x productivity gains with 0.1x global automation costs**. Every developed economy achieved prosperity through automation. India cannot import its way there—the economics don't work. We must build it.

## WHAT EXISTS TODAY

**Durga AI** — Seven production AI agents solving real workflows: document generation, compliance automation, sales orchestration. Not demos. Real deployments. Real revenue.

**Evolve Robots** — Functional robots in schools and SMEs. Not concepts. Hardware that works, ships, and operates in Indian conditions at Indian price points.

This isn't aspiration. It's operational.

## THE ARBITRAGE

**Global reality:** Humanoids are coming. Boston Dynamics, Figure, Tesla—all targeting $50-150K price points for Western markets.

**India reality:** We need humanoids at ₹5-15 lakhs. That's not iteration—it's re-engineering from first principles.

**Our edge:** We're already building the subsystems. Motors, control systems, perception stack, AI integration—each component has immediate market value while contributing to the long-term humanoid platform. We monetize the journey, not just the destination.

## THE ENGINEERING PATH

**Years 0-2:** Component systems. Education robots. SME automation. AI agents scaling. Each product line profitable.

**Years 2-3:** Integrated subsystems. Teleoperated torsos for dangerous jobs. Mobile manipulation platforms. The humanoid emerges in pieces, each piece earning revenue.

**Years 3-5:** Humanoid V1. Not competing with Boston Dynamics on backflips. Competing on price-performance for Indian labor substitution. Nurse assistant. Shop floor worker. Security guard. Real jobs, real economics.

## WHY THIS WORKS

1. **Vertical integration** — We control the stack from actuators to AI. No dependency on Chinese supply chains or American software licenses.

2. **Dual revenue streams** — AI agents generate SaaS revenue today. Robots generate hardware revenue today. Humanoid R&D is funded by profitable products, not venture capital hope.

3. **Market timing** — India's demographic dividend becomes a demographic burden in 15 years. Automation isn't optional—it's existential.

4. **Cost structure** — Indian engineering talent at 1/5th Silicon Valley cost. Indian manufacturing at 1/3rd Chinese cost. Indian market willing to pay for 80% functionality at 20% price.

## THE ANTI-PATTERNS WE AVOID

- No humanoid hype without revenue
- No AI demos without deployments
- No hardware concepts without manufacturing
- No five-year promises without quarterly milestones
- No Silicon Valley burn rates for Indian market prices

## CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT

**₹25 crores enables:**
- 10x AI agent customer acquisition
- 3x robotics manufacturing capacity
- Humanoid subsystem development with revenue milestones
- 18-month runway to profitability

**Capital efficiency:** Every rupee generates either immediate revenue or de-risks technical milestones. No pure R&D burn.

## THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH

India will either build its automation stack or remain a services economy. China built manufacturing. America built software. India must build embodied intelligence—AI that manipulates the physical world at Indian economics.

We're not asking you to bet on humanoids. We're asking you to bet on India's inevitability—that a country of 1.4 billion will demand and create its own automation infrastructure. We're simply the ones engineering it.

**The question isn't whether India needs this. It's whether you'll fund the team that's already building it.**
